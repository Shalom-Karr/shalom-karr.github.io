## Philosophy

I believe in building applications that solve real-world problems or enhance user interactions.

I'm also keen on ensuring users have the information they need, as demonstrated by creating clear setup guides for my tools.

## Future Interests (Speculative based on current tech)

*   Expanding PWA capabilities (offline data storage, background sync for pending actions).
*   Deeper integration of push notifications for user engagement.
*   Exploring more advanced frontend frameworks or libraries if project complexity grows.
*   Further enhancing security measures and data privacy.
