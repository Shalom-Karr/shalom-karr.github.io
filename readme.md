## Setup & Deployment

1.  **Clone the Repository (Optional):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shalom-Karr/YOUR_PORTFOLIO_REPO_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_PORTFOLIO_REPO_NAME
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_PORTFOLIO_REPO_NAME` with the actual name of your repository if you create one for this portfolio.)*

2.  **Customize Content:**
    *   Open `index.html` and update any remaining placeholders:
        *   Twitter handle (`@YourTwitterHandle`) in meta tags (or remove if not applicable).
        *   Ensure all image paths in `<img>` tags and meta tags are correct.
        *   Verify all external links (projects, social media).
    *   Add/replace images in the `img/` folder as needed.
    *   Update `favicon.ico`.

3.  **Amplitude API Key:**
    *   Open `index.html`.
    *   Find the Amplitude initialization script in the `<head>`.
    *   Replace `'YOUR_AMPLITUDE_API_KEY'` with your **actual Amplitude API Key**.

4.  **Local Development:**
    *   Open `index.html` directly in your browser or use a simple local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server extension).

5.  **Deployment:**
    *   The site is currently deployed on **Netlify**.
    *   To update, push changes to the linked GitHub repository. Netlify will automatically build and deploy.
    *   Alternatively, the static files can be deployed to any static site hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Vercel, etc.).

## Using the Site

*   Navigate through sections using the top navigation bar or by scrolling.
*   The navigation bar is responsive and uses a "burger" menu on smaller screens.
*   Project cards link to live demos and GitHub repositories.
*   Contact links provide various methods to get in touch.
*   An AI Agent widget (from Jotform) should be available for interaction.

## Future Considerations / Potential Enhancements

*   Activate and configure Amplitude Session Replay more deeply.
*   Add actual screenshots for project previews instead of placeholders.
*   Implement more granular page view tracking for sections if default Amplitude tracking isn't sufficient.
*   Add a contact form (e.g., using Netlify Forms or another service) as an alternative to direct mailto/tel links.
*   Further PWA enhancements (more robust offline caching, add to home screen prompt details).
